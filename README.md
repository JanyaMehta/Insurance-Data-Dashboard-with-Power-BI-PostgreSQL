# -Insurance-Data-Dashboard-with-Power-BI-PostgreSQL

A hands-on **Power BI project** simulating a real-world insurance analytics workflow. This project connects **PostgreSQL database** data directly to Power BI and demonstrates interactive dashboards, data profiling, and visualization techniques for insurance datasets.

## üìù Project Overview

In this project, I explored **insurance-related data** including policy details, customer demographics, premiums, coverage, and claims. Unlike typical sample projects, the data was **imported into PostgreSQL** first, reflecting a realistic workflow used in analytics teams.

The dashboard showcases key metrics, interactive visualizations, and dynamic insights, helping users explore patterns in policy types, claim statuses, and customer demographics.
